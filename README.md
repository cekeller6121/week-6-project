This is my project for Week 6 of The Iron Yard. We were supposed to create a website similar to Twitter where users can sign up, login in an authenticated session, and be able to create posts of their own as well as view posts from other users. I was able to create a database for storing user information and able to authenticate users in a session. I created a feature to store a username in a 'liked' post, however not able to get past only one user being able to like a post nor did I get a chance to finish a feature for deleting posts only owned by the signed in user. I had a lot of fun and learned a lot on this project, and would definitely like to re-visit it at a later date.
